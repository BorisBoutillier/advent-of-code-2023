# Advent of Code 2023

This is the code that I have developped to solve the puzzles of the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/)

This is raw code quality, where my goal is to find the solution, not to be the most readable/maintainable code, in particular no cleaning is done after I have solved the puzzle.

Usage 
```
# To run the provided example for each part:
cargo test --bin day-XX
# To run the 
cargo run --release --bin day-XX -- [part1|part2] (-i|--input path_of_file)?
```

- XX is the day
- [part1|part2] is for part 1 or part 2.
- --input: Defined path of input file to use, defaults to day-XX/input.txt, whichh is my personal input file from AoC.
