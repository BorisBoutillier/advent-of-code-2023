# Advent of Code 2023

This is the code that I have developped to solve the puzzles of the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/)

This is raw code quality, where my goal is to find the solution, not to be the most readable/maintainable code, in particular no cleaning is done after I have solved the puzzle.

Run with 
```
cargo run --release --bin day-XX -- [part1|part2] (-e|--example)? (-i|--input path_of_file)?
```

- XX is the day
- [part1|part2] is for part 1 or part 2.
- --example: When set uses day-XX/example.txt as input file
- --file: Defined path of input file to use, when not provided and not --example, uses day-XX/input.txt, my input file.

As said, this code is raw, with no comment, no explanation. But if you are interested in one of my solution and have questions, don't hesitate to file an issue or contact me on discord, username 'bobox_214'.
